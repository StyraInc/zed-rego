# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Only the most recent release of the extension is supported.

Security issues — like any other confirmed bugs — will be addressed as quickly as possible.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Security issues may be reported either by email to [devrel@styra.com](mailto:devrel@styra.com), or to the admins in the
[Styra Community Slack](https://communityinviter.com/apps/styracommunity/signup). You should expect a response within 24
hours, but most likely much sooner.
