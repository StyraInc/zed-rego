# Contributing

We'd love to have you contribute to the Zed Rego extension!

## Development

To install the extension in development mode, first make sure to have [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
installed.

Next, clone this repository. Now from the Zed "Extensions" menu, choose "Install Dev Extension" and select the directory
where you cloned this repository.

## Syntax highlighting

The zed-rego extension uses the tree-sitter grammar provided by the
[tree-sitter-rego](https://github.com/FallenAngel97/tree-sitter-rego) project, and contributions to imprive syntax
highlighting and other basic language features should be made there. If you have had code merged into that project,
make sure to submit a PR to us updating the [extension.toml](../extension.toml) file in this repo to point at the
latest commit in the tree-sitter-rego project.

## Language server features

The language server features in this extension are provided by [Regal](https://github.com/styrainc/regal), and new
features and fixes should be submitted to that project directly. See the Regal docs on
[contributing](https://github.com/StyraInc/regal/blob/main/docs/CONTRIBUTING.md) for how to get started!

## Community

Finally, if you're interested in discussing a feature, bug, or just development in general, please join us in the
